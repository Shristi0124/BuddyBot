# ðŸ¤– BuddyBot

**BuddyBot** is a simple AI chatbot project Iâ€™m currently working on. The idea is to build an assistant that helps users with productivity tips, wellness suggestions, and general queries â€” all through natural conversation.

This is just the starting phase of the project, and Iâ€™ll be gradually adding new features like better AI responses, a cleaner UI, and smarter personalization.
